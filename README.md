# Spawning Modes
## Default
In the default spawning mode, bots simply stay at their positions when they die. To activate default spawning, place a ring spawn point and remove it.

## Ring Spawning
In the ring spawning mode, bots are teleported to a random position in the ring after they die. This is great for a quick-setup with unpredictable bot locations. To activate ring spawning, navigate to the "Ring Spawning" menu page and place a ring, or press Reload if you already have a ring placed.

## Preset Points Spawning
In the preset points spawning mode, bots are teleported to one of the random points you place, and move off a bit in a random direction, the distance depending on your variance value. To activate preset points spawning, navigate to the "Preset Points Spawning" menu page and place a spawn point, or press Reload if you already have spawn points placed.
